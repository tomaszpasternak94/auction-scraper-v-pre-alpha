# scraping_the_offers

When I was designing this code I had three main goals:
- the first of all this code should can scrap/"scan" a website in some main parameters (like price, title, and item reference - for example like link to the product)
- the second thing, this code should can create a data frame with the above mentioned parameters (.csv format)
- and the last of all, this program should can send an mail to the clients with attachment (data base). Additionally can scrap a website and send an mail in interval of time (like ones a week).

### Python 3.7.1
### Code was created in Jupyter Notebook (code divided into two elements executed one after another - libraries loaded once, then looped operation of the second section).
### Additionally in this code I can used module of (Pandas) and (NumPy) to management a Data Frame.
